# React Native: Addressing Uninitialized State/Prop Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access state variables or props before they have been initialized.  The `UninitializedProp.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `UninitializedPropSolution.js` presents the corrected version.

The issue arises when a component tries to use state or props within its render method before these values have been set or updated via async operations or other lifecycle methods.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or even app crashes.

The solution emphasizes using conditional rendering and potentially loading states to handle the period between component mount and data availability.
